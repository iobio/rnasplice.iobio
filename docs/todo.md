# TO DO

1. ShowTranscriptMenu doesn't work (transcript menu button shows when diagrams are being loaded)

2. Closest exon to acceptor (or donor), should consider upstream and downstream as long as exon is in correct direction and not the exon of the other site. (See NEB Exon 113 > Intronic chr2:151,567,137
)

3. For sites not landing in exon, calculate delta by determining closest exon and using exon.start or end depending on strand and junction end.
