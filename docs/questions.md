# Questions

1. How to characterize splice junction where donor and acceptor within an exon (on the MANE SELECT transcript)
2. Should all transcripts be considered when locating exon of donor/acceptor site? For example, some splice junctions have canonical donor and acceptor sites on a transcript that is not the MANE SELECT transcript. Would this splice junction be considered canonical?
3. In sequence chart, how do we show insertions and deletions? (Look at how IGV does it)
